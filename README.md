# Clone validation workflow

*Some DASH Additions during execution and development:

-soft links are not appreciated by the input flag (--fastq) cannot detect fastq.gz's etc..
-attempting to pull data using s3+fuse appears to be too slow, rsync data (fastq.gz's) locally or possibly use FSX in production
-using aws cli cp command to pull down locally, faster than rsync :this:
-min vCPU is 4 (t2.medium has capacity 2) - set machine size to at least that!
-do not run as root? no error but only appears to run using sudo under less priv'd account (edited) 
(no mounting an S3 bucket in local FS for input's)

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
that can be used to de novo assemble plasmid sequences from Oxford Nanopore data. The workflow allows users to verify complete artificial constructs.



## Introduction

The workflow accepts FASTQ as the primary input.

Optional inputs:

* A `host_reference` FASTA file.
  
* A primers TSV file if they differ from the default pRham/T7.

The steps of the workflow are as follows - 

* If a `host_reference` is provided, [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) is used to align the reads to the `host_reference`, aligned reads are filtered out.

* The reads are then trimmed at the ends using [Seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/) with the provided `--trim_length` parameter. 

* The sequences are then downsampled using the tool [Rasusa](https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa).

* [Trycycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler) is used to create 3 subsamples which are each assembled using [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye).

* If there are concatemers in the assembly these are found using minimap2 and deconcatenated using a Python script. 

* Trycycler is used to reconcile the subsampled assemblies into one final assembly. This is polished with [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka).

* [Seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/) is used to find inserts using the primers supplied to the `--primers` parameter. 

* The assembly is annotated using [pLannotate](https://github.com/barricklab/pLannotate) with the default database containing entries from [fpbase](https://www.fpbase.org/), [Swiss-Prot](https://www.expasy.org/resources/uniprotkb-swiss-prot), [Rfam](https://rfam.org/) and [snapgene](https://www.snapgene.com/). 

* A quality score for the assembly is provided by Medaka.

* Optionally a reference insert sequence can be provided with --insert_reference, which is aligned to the consensus and any variants are reported by [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html).



## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and 
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either docker or singularity is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.
For more information on running EPI2ME Labs workflows [visit out website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-clone-validation --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a consensus fasta file for each sample
* a csv showing the pass or fail status of each sample
* a feature table containing annotations for each of the samples
* an HTML report document detailing the primary findings of the workflow.
